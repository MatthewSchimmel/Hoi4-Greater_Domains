### Greater Domains Refocused: By Matthew Schimmel
This is a mod for the video game "Hearts of Iron IV" that allows the integration of more areas of the game map through some additional focuses.
It allows the integration of some close states using decisions to add cores including ones missed by bypassing focuses, plus a few others based on my analysis of historical demographics.

[Available on Steam here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2844729564)

Hungary, Bulgaria, Russia, Finland, and The United States were given dedicated decisions to core nearby states. Some, like the U.S. decisions, are edited versions of existing decisions to core states. Others come from a standardized template.

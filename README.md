# Greater Germany Refocused
[Available on Steam here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2844729564)

This is a mod for the video game "Hearts of Iron IV" that allows the integration of German areas of the game map through some additional focuses.
It allows the integration of external German states using decisions to add cores including ones missed by bypassing focuses, plus a few others based on my analysis of historical demographics.

Germany has an expanded focus tree, with five extra focuses off of Rhineland, and one off of <i>Form The Reichskommisariats</i>. They allow for the coring and/or splitting of harder states not included in the decisions menu, such as Switzerland or the low countries.

Germany now has a new decisions category titled Volkersintegration, unlocked through the "Proclaim Greater German Reich" national focus. Through this window, you can core missed states. For example, if you get denied the sudetenland or must bypass the focus instead of completing it, you can use these decisions to core them eventually. Others states like Poznan and Nordschleswig can be integrated because of their historical ownership before the Great War.

Hungary, Bulgaria, Russia, Finland, and The United States were also given dedicated decisions to core nearby states. Some, like the U.S. decisions, are edited versions of existing decisions to core states. Others come from a standardized template.

- SWITZERLAND: Switzerland is now sepereated into four states: two German, a Frech and an Italian. This allows proper partitioning. Incompatible with other map mods.
- Adds the states of Nordschleswig and East Saint Lawrence (break-offs of Jutland and Saint Lawrence respectively). These states have no buildings and merely exist for better border management.
- NETHERLANDS: Can be integrated by Germany through the "Integrate the Netherlands" national focus.
- BELGIUM: Flanders and Walloon can be cored by Netherlands and France respectively through the "Empower Belgian Seperatists" national focus.
- Austria, Sudetenland, and Polish Corridor: Can be cored if the Anschluss, Demand Sudetenland, and Danzig or War focuses are bypassed or the countries deny.
- ITALY: New German events to try to gain influence over the previously Austrian South Tyrolean population.
- Removes the Russian decisions to core Finnish cores (unhistorical & unrealistic)
- Added NEW loading screen pictures! These are real, historical photographs.
- Dozens of all NEW flags for many nations, including dedicated reichskommisariat flags!
- Adds new releasable nations of Quebec, Greenland, New England, and Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as Slovakia (already in game but with no starting cores).

#### Bugs/errors:
- There are errors coming from the <i>Form Scandinavia</i> file (scripted effect). These are due to errors in the scope. However, they do not appear to affect gameplay.
- There are errors coming from the <i>events/Italy.txt</i> file due to "Malformed tokens". They also do not appear to affect gameplay.
- There are errors coming from the </i>map/buildings.txt</i> file. These are because of the fact that I did not copy and refactor file to alter the buildings supposedly found within the new map states I created. However, these too don't affect gameplay.

#### The future
 I plan on adding more RK puppets to the RK decision category. I know there are many mods that do this, but many are to maximalistic or otherwise unrealistic. I plan on taking from other mods and editing/smoothing the edges before integration into this mod.
 Possible Puppets:
  - RK Bohemia-Moravia (rename the cities)
  - Kingdom of Poland
  - Teutonic Order (Baltic Union with new cosmetic tag and flag)
  - RK Moscowien
  - RK Kaukasien (possibly Georgian formable?)

# Hoi4-Greater_Germany
This is a mod for the video game "Hearts of Iron IV" that allows the integration of German areas of the game map through some additional focuses.
This is a mod that allows the integration of external German states using decisions to add cores. It allows you to core states you missed by bypassing focuses, plus a few others.

Germany has an expanded focus tree, with five extra focuses off of Rhineland, and one off of form the reichskommisariats. They allow for the coring and breaking of harder states not included in the decisions menu.
Germany now has a new decisions category titled Volkersintegration, unlocked through the "Proclaim Greater German Reich" national focus. Through this window, you can core missed states. For example, if you get denied the sudetenland or must bypass the focus instead of completing it, you can use these decisions to core them eventually. Others states like Poznan and Nordschleswig can be integrated because of their historical ownership before the Great War.

- SWITZERLAND: Switzerland is now sepereated into four states: two German, a Frech and an Italian. This allows proper partitioning. Incompatible with other map mods.
- BELGIUM: Flanders and Walloon can be cored by Netherlands and France respectively through the "Empower Belgian Seperatists" national focus.
- NETHERLANDS: Can be integrated by Germany through the "Integrate the Netherlands" national focus.
- Austria, Sudetenland, and Polish Corridor: Can be cored if the Anschluss, Demand Sudetenland, and Danzig or War focuses are bypassed or the countries deny.
- ITALY: New events to try to gain influence over the previously Austrian South Tyrolean population
- Hungary, Bulgaria, Russia, Finland, United States: Decisions category to core states missed through dedicated focuses, or immediately if no dlc.
– Removes the Russian decisions to core Finnish cores (unhistorical & unrealistic)
– Adds the states of Nordschleswig and East Saint Lawrence (break-offs of Jutland and Saint Lawrence respectively). These states have no buildings and merely exist for better border management
– Added NEW loading screen pictures! These are real, historical photographs
– Dozens of all NEW flags for many nations, including dedicated reichskommisariat flags!
– Adds new releasable nations of Quebec, Greenland, New England, and Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as Slovakia (already in game but with no starting cores)

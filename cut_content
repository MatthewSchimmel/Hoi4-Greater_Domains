Here is the focus for the German focus tree that was cut out. It's function was to create a scandinavian puppet state. Will make part of another mod.

		focus = {
		id = GER_craft_scandinavian_union
		prerequisite = { focus = GER_proclaim_greater_germanic_reich }
		icon = GFX_goal_generic_alliance
		available = {
		}
		cancel = {
		}
		cancel_if_invalid = yes
		x = 3
		y = 1
		relative_position_id = GER_proclaim_greater_germanic_reich

		cost = 5
		ai_will_do = {
			factor = 10
		}
		completion_reward = {

		}
	}
